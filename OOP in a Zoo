/*i coaxed up compliments until my throat burned with my own sweet-talk
and i contorted my jaw into a smile until my teeth burned with numbness 
i vomited up giggles to each jestering innuedos, playing me like nintendo
i vomited up streams of laughter to their 
and as i stood in the center of the circus ring with nothing more i could hurl
i heard the crowd stand and apluad "good girl"
